## 📝 Prepared Content

### Bio and Statement

**Short Bio (2-3 paragraphs):**
Joaquin Arriola (handle @Johnsneedart) is an illustrator with over three years of focused practice in observational and anatomical drawing. He works primarily in grayscale, translating complex forms into clear, expressive studies for editorial, portrait, and commission-based projects. Over this period Joaquin has completed numerous commissions for private clients and small publishers, developing a concise visual language centered on form, contrast and narrative clarity.

Joaquin combines traditional pen-and-ink techniques with careful value studies to create work that is both precise and emotionally resonant. He approaches each commission with a collaborative mindset, offering clear timelines, progress sketches, and responsive revisions to ensure the final piece meets editorial or client needs.

**Artist Statement (optional, 1 paragraph):**
My practice investigates the structure and movement of the human figure through tonal study and line. Working in pen, ink and grayscale, I aim to communicate anatomical truth and subtle gesture while preserving an immediate, handcrafted quality that supports storytelling across editorial and commissioned work.

**Hero Tagline:**
<Vitalism and art, a way of life>
