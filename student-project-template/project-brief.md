## Design Direction

### Visual Style

<!-- Describe your aesthetic approach -->

- Decision (Layout): Implement a responsive modular grid for the Projects page with a hero/detail view for featured works (grid → selected hero). This preserves focus on single pieces while allowing quick scanning of the portfolio.

- Decision (Content): Each project card includes: title, year, medium (materials/techniques) and 1-line summary; project detail pages include a short case study (1 paragraph), a process gallery, and tags. This supports the pedagogical goal of demonstrating process and technique.
