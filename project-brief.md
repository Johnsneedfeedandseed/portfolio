### Who is it for?

- Individuals seeking commissions: private clients requesting custom work (book illustrations, portraits, bespoke pieces).

- Publishing houses and book publishers: publishers needing editorial illustration, cover art, and assets for print and digital publications.

- Professional studios and creative agencies: design studios, art directors, and agencies outsourcing illustration for commercial projects and branding.

### Why does it matter?

The portfolio turns visitors into clients by showcasing work, process and contact paths clearly. It helps each target audience quickly: 

- See relevant examples and applications (commissions, editorial, branding).
- Assess fit and professionalism through case pieces, process notes and clear visuals.

## 📝 Prepared Content

### Bio and Statement

**Short Bio (2-3 paragraphs):**
Joaquin Arriola (handle @Johnsneedart) is an illustrator with over three years of focused practice in observational and anatomical drawing. He works primarily in grayscale, translating complex forms into clear, expressive studies for editorial, portrait, and commission-based projects. Over this period Joaquin has completed numerous commissions for private clients and small publishers, developing a concise visual language centered on form, contrast and narrative clarity.

Joaquin combines traditional pen-and-ink techniques with careful value studies to create work that is both precise and emotionally resonant. He approaches each commission with a collaborative mindset, offering clear timelines, progress sketches, and responsive revisions to ensure the final piece meets editorial or client needs.

**Artist Statement (optional, 1 paragraph):**
My practice investigates the structure and movement of the human figure through tonal study and line. Working in pen, ink and grayscale, I aim to communicate anatomical truth and subtle gesture while preserving an immediate, handcrafted quality that supports storytelling across editorial and commissioned work.

**Hero Tagline:**
<Vitalism and art, a way of life>

**ImageKit optimization:**
- [ ] Create responsive variants for each image (thumbnail, medium, full):
  - Thumbnail: `tr:w-400,h-300,q-80,f-auto`
  - Medium: `tr:w-800,q-80,f-auto`
  - Full / Lightbox: `tr:w-1200,q-85,f-auto`
- [ ] Serve responsive images with srcset + sizes so the browser chooses the best transform. Example:

```html
srcset="<url>?tr:w-400 400w, <url>?tr:w-800 800w, <url>?tr:w-1200 1200w" sizes="(max-width:600px)100vw,33vw"
```
- [ ] Include width/height attributes (or CSS aspect-ratio) to avoid layout shifts (CLS).
- [ ] Lazy-load non-critical images (`loading="lazy"`) and prioritize hero/above-the-fold images (`fetchpriority="high"`).
- [ ] Use a low-quality image placeholder (LQIP) or a tiny blurred transform while the full image loads, then swap to the chosen transform.
- [ ] Ensure every image has concise, descriptive alt text (aim for ≤125 characters). For decorative images use `alt=""` and aria-hidden if needed.
- [ ] Use sensible quality (q) trade-offs: 70–85 for web thumbnails, 85+ for print or critical lightbox views.
- [ ] Version assets or use the `updatedAt` param to bust caches when replacing files.
- [ ] Wrap images with `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` when a caption or credit is required and ensure keyboard-accessible lightbox controls.
- [ ] Test the result with Lighthouse (Performance, LCP, CLS) and Accessibility checks; iterate if needed.
